# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About
Hello, my name is Ilya, and I'm a frontend developer from Moscow. I started coding about three years ago. I began with Python and creating simple Telegram bots. However, frontend development soon captured my interest, and I completely changed my development path. I've been working on frontend development for almost two years now. Throughout my learning journey, I've never purchased courses, and all my knowledge to date comes from open sources. Currently, I primarily focus on developing with Angular. Previously, I studied React. I'm also interested in TypeScript. Occasionally, I work with WordPress.

I enjoy working on user experience and improving it. Apart from development, I'm passionate about UI/UX design. For almost all my projects, I've developed not only the frontend but also the design.
